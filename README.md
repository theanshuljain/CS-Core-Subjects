# Core Computer Science subjects' notes required for Data-related jobs.

This repo contains organized notes that either I made or found on the internet on computer science subjects that are essential for data-related job roles such as:

i, Data Architect
ii, Data Engineer
iii, Data Analyst
iv, Data Manager
v, Data Warehouse Engineer
vi, Any other job title used by companies but essentially the job remains same.

These subjects are NOT ENOUGH for Data Science job roles as it involves deeper understanding of Machine Learning, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence.
